# Early Cancer Detection with CNN-based Active Contour Model

## Overview

### Datasets
- Wisconsin Dataset (Breast Cancer)
- MICCAIBraTS 2013 (Brain Tumor)

### Input Images
- MRI or PET/CT scans Images

## Objectives
Detect and classify cancer tumors in medical images using advanced image processing techniques, with a focus on the deep CNN-based Active Contour Model.

## Phases

### 1. Pre-Processing
- Fast Bilateral Filter
- Zig-Zag Order
- CLAHE
- Average Intensity Replacement
- Patches Conversion

### 2. Tumor Segmentation
- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- Active Contour Models (ACMs)
  - Parameters: heterogeneous lesions, intensity inhomogeneous lesions, low contrast lesions
- Deep Learning

### 3. Feature Extraction
- Fisher Vector Encoding (FVE)
- 8-directions

### 4. Feature Selection
- Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)

### 5. Classification
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

## Performance Metrics
Evaluate success based on:
- Computation Time
- Classification Accuracy
- Segmentation Accuracy
